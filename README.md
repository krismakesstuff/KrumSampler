# KrumSampler


## A simple to use Drum Sampler

- You can drag and drop files into the drop area and create a new module that triggers the sample based off a midi note assigned by the user. This allows you to record and playback midi clips as you would expect. 
- The file browser lets you add whole folders of samples for easy access to your favorite packs, and let's you preview them. It also keeps track of your recently used samples.
- Each module has it's own volume and pan and  can be reassigned and recolored at anytime and the changes will reflect on the keyboard below. 
- This is a cross-platform plug-in that comes in AAX, AU, and VST3 formats.
- NOTE: THIS HAS NOT BEEN TESTED!!! Although, it runs fine in most basic cases, there is some serious work to do in terms of optimization and general reliability. Please bear with me as I work to make this better. I am beyond my depth but learning quickly.
