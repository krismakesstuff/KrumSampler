# KrumSampler


## A simple to use Drum Sampler

- You can drag and drop files into the drop area and create a new module that triggers the sample based off a midi note assigned by the user. This allows you to record and playback midi clips as you would expect. 
- The file browser lets you add whole folders of samples for easy access to your favorite packs, and let's you preview them. It also keeps track of your recently used samples.
- Each module has it's own volume and pan and  can be reassigned and recolored at anytime and the changes will reflect on the keyboard below.
