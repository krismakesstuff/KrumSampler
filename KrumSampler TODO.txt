KrumSampler TODO:

- write more detailed code comments
- test multiple instances
- test on mac
- make quick vid
- push to main and make 1.5.0-beta release.

- create Docker documentation? 

- had a dragging module crash after a deleting many modules at once. Crash happened in getModulesDraggedArea()

- not reloading state on first open in ableton
- update documentation in code and repo
- test in all DAWs and platforms
- make a track with it
- ctrl+f "TODO" current project


OPTIMIZATION:
- loading images from binary on module creation, good or bad?
- make loading audio previewer a more encapsulated process. Each callback for each item in the FileBrwoser is using similar if not identical code. 

FOR NEXT UPDATE:
- trigger mode?
	- let's you choose between one shot or re-trigger
- velocity? 
	- let's you assign a sample to a velocity range, use FMOD range sliders design
- add drop shadows on module buttons and sliders? 
	- This will help the modules be easier to understand and will just look better I think
- add copy module button, copies ther current settings
	- make this work with multi-select?
- add small fade in and fade out to sample start and end positions
	- this will let you make any start and end position without getting clicks and pops
	- make fade amount adjustable?
- Add plugin presets
- add global settings
	- allows user to change default behaviors of function
	- multi-control options, mod key, default behaviour
	- mutli-sample module creatging
		- should all modules default to multi-control and listen for everything?
		- midi and color and volume and pan, etc. No for now but could be an option
	- auto adding files to favorites when directly dropping from filebrowser or external app
	- auto showing colorPalette on a new module
	- auto previewer default
- experiment with changing a filter based on velocity
	- the idea being that this would make the velocity sound more real
	- I think it just needs to be a high pass filter that changes it's cutoff depending on the veloctiy played
	- make the sensitivity of the filter adjustable
- consider moving pitchSlider and reverseButton above the panSlider, under the thumbnail. 
	- try to create a seperation of sample manipulating creative parameters and utility parameters. 
- revisit on shot multiControl action, I think it's clunky but maybe not
